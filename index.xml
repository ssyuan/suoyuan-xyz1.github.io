      <description>&lt;p&gt;zkMove has been increasingly attracting people’s attention recently, and as the founder of the project, I get misc questions from time to time. Although the backgrounds of the questioners varied, the questions raised up were quite similar. So I would like to take this chance to answer those questions in one post and I hope it could help to illustrate a big picture of zkMove.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>zkMove at a Glance With the boom of Defi and the emergence of non-financial smart contracts, the scalability of public chains, represented by Ethereum, is being increasingly challenged. Although technologies such as POS and sharding can improve the throughput rate to a certain extent, the root cause of congestion still exists in the long run. This is because any transaction that wants to be on the chain requires most nodes across the network to verify its validity, and the method of verification is to execute the transaction repeatedly.</description>
