      <description>&lt;p&gt;zkMove has been increasingly attracting peopleâ€™s attention recently, and as the founder of the project, I get misc questions from time to time. Although the backgrounds of the questioners varied, the questions raised up were quite similar. So I would like to take this chance to answer those questions in one post and I hope it could help to illustrate a big picture of zkMove.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
